Document Type: GEMINI-TARGETED  
Source: Strategic integration planning and audit-driven analysis  
Date: September 24, 2025  
Status: ACTIVE - Foundation documentation complete  
Cross-References: [audit-findings.md](./audit-findings.md), [integration-roadmap.md](./integration-roadmap.md)

## DECISION_SUMMARY

### ARCHITECTURAL_APPROACH: Dual-Strategy Documentation Architecture
**Decision**: Implement human-facing README.md files alongside Gemini-optimized content files  
**Status**: ADOPTED  
**Date**: September 2025  
**Impact**: HIGH - Affects all documentation creation patterns  

### REASONING
```yaml
Drivers:
  - Human users need accessible documentation
  - AI systems require structured, parseable content
  - Workflow templates must serve both audiences effectively
  - Maintenance overhead must be minimized

Constraints:
  - Single-source-of-truth principle
  - Clear ownership and update responsibilities
  - Consistent formatting across all content
  - Tool integration requirements

Alternatives_Considered:
  - Single documentation format (REJECTED: Poor AI optimization)
  - Completely separate systems (REJECTED: Maintenance burden)
  - Auto-generated dual formats (DEFERRED: Complexity)
```

## TOOL_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE
